I initially created this translation tool for one of my other projects to reduce the time spent translating i18n files.

While developing this project, I aimed to make it user-friendly and versatile for general i18n use cases.

If this tool helps you, it would be my pleasure.

## Feature

- ü§ñ Utilize AI services for translation
- üëÅÔ∏è Monitor file changes for automatic re-execution
- üôå Run alongside your project with ease

## Task

### üîé Extract

Extract i18n files from the specified path and save them to the designated output directory.

### üìö Translate

Translate i18n files using AI services and save the results to the specified output directory.

### Source

You can configure the tool using three different methods, with the settings being read and merged in the following
order:

1. `.env` file
2. Command line parameters
3. Inquirer prompts

For more details, refer to the `src/workflow.ts` file.

#### 1. `.env` file

You can specify options in your project‚Äôs `.env` file using the `TRANSLATION_` prefix.

For example:

```text
TRANSLATOR_PATTERN=^(?i)test
TRANSLATOR_TASKS=extract1,translate
TRANSLATOR_DIRS=./test
TRANSLATOR_TEST=111
TRANSLATOR_KEY=sk-5805c22222228aad2d5386e877fa
```

Ensure that all options are in `UPPERCASE` and `SNAKE_CASE`.

#### 2. command line parameters

When running the project from the command line, you can use `--option` to set configurations.

```bash
npx @shermant/i18n-translator --pattern=tttt --exts vue js --watch
```

Note: Command line settings will override those in the .env file.

#### 3. inquirer

Based on the selected tasks, the program will check which options need to be set before execution.

If any options are missing, the program will prompt you to input them through an inquirer flow.

### Provider

As of 2024-09-02, the project supports `deepseek` as the AI service provider.

In the future, I plan to integrate `LangChain` to support a variety of AI service providers.

## Usage

```bash
npx @shermant/i18n-translator
bunx @shermant/i18n-translator
```

This version is more polished and clearer, ensuring proper grammar and consistent formatting.
